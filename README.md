# Passalessandra
 This app contains a Unity reinterpretation of the italian tv show [Passaparola](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passaparola_(programma_televisivo)). The name is adapted to fit a generic newly-graduated girl called Alessandra. The game was initially developed in lees than a week. Some major improvements (like loading custom questions) have been added later.
