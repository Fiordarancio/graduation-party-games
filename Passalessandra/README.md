### Passalessandra (the brand new customizable Passaparola)

# Goal
Players are asked questions whose answer begins with a given letter. Players have limited time to answer all or most questions. 
During each question, each player can try to answer and continue, or say "Passalessandra!" (or every magic word of your choice) to pass the turn to the other player.

The player who answers all or most questions first wins.

# Controls
Use mouse click to select the letter to activate and start playing. 
The green button sets that letter as correct, while the yellow one as idle and the red one as wrong, passing the control to the other player.
The small blue button on the left resets the status of the letter to default, while the other with the clock icon restores some seconds for the player.

Each of the aformentioned controls can be issued by keyboard. Press:
* Z,C to select the previous/next unanswered question
* F to mark correct
* G to mark idle
* H to mark wrong
* N to reset the letter
* M to restore time

## Coming soon
Customizable json/txt file in which you can put your custom question&answer couples, and a template in which you can put a png file for your player's profile.

By now, you must hardcode your custom QAs in UXManager.cs before building the game.
